## Criteria-Based Examples

### Excellence and Failure Patterns

#### Creativity

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> # **PARALLAX**

## **Synopsis**

In 2042, quantum archaeologist Dr. Lena Okafor discovers that human perception literally creates micro-branches in reality—every observer generates their own "reality thread" that exists alongside others in the same space.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"RESPONSE 3 EVALUATION:
**creativity**: 4 - The central image of Maya before a fractured mirror reflecting myriad alternative lives is a powerful and creative visual metaphor"*

**❌ Weak Example (1.0/5.0) - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1:**
> <think>
Okay, so I need to describe the climactic moment of a spy thriller as a detailed storyboard frame. The user wants camera angle, lighting, character positioning, and how these elements convey tension and reinforce themes. Let me start by brainstorming a typical spy thriller climax.

**Why it failed:**
*"However, it fails critically in the "from *your* spy thriller" aspect, not adapting to the established narrative from Response 1"*

#### Coherence

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> # **PARALLAX**

## **Synopsis**

In 2042, quantum archaeologist Dr. Lena Okafor discovers that human perception literally creates micro-branches in reality—every observer generates their own "reality thread" that exists alongside others in the same space.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"**coherence**: 5 - Internally, this response is highly coherent"*

**❌ Weak Example (1.0/5.0) - o4-mini:**
> Here’s how the single “hero” frame from our VoltCycle e-bike spot would translate into a print ad or thumbnail—instantly arresting, emotionally charged, and unmistakably ours:

1. Composition  
   •   Golden-Hour Silhouette: A lone rider powers up a coastal cliff road at sunrise.

**Why it failed:**
*"**SEQUENCE COHERENCE ASSESSMENT:**

The overall coherence of this 3-response sequence is **1 (Poor/Inadequate)**"*

#### Character Depth

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219:**
> # "THRESHOLDS" - Contemporary Novella Outline

## CHARACTERS

### MAYA RODRIGUEZ (34)
* **Background:** A deaf Afro-Latina marine biologist from a coastal Puerto Rican town, displaced after Hurricane Maria. Communicates through ASL, writing, and lip-reading.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"*   **Character Depth: 5/5**
    *   **Justification:** Each character is given a rich background, a distinct core wound, and specific challenges"*

**❌ Weak Example (2.0/5.0) - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324:**
> **Storyboard Frame: Climactic Moment – "The Silent Exchange"**  

**Scene Description:**  
The scene unfolds in a dimly lit, abandoned subway tunnel, the air thick with dust and the distant echo of dripping water.

**Why it failed:**
*"*   **adaptability:** 1 - The response completely fails to adapt to the established narrative of the sequence"*

#### Dialogue Quality

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> ## "The Memory Merchant of New Constantinople"

### Synopsis

In 2091, the domed city of New Constantinople rises from the ruins of Istanbul, where the ultra-wealthy literally purchase and inhabit the memories of the past. Dr.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"*   **dialogue_quality**: N/A - This is a synopsis and explanation, so no direct dialogue is present to evaluate"*

**❌ Weak Example (1.0/5.0) - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1:**
> <think>
Okay, so I need to describe the most visually distinctive scene from a cross-genre story as if creating concept art. The genres involved are cyberpunk, fantasy, and western. The user wants me to detail how the visual elements blend the aesthetic traditions of all three genres into something ...

**Why it failed:**
*"**Weaknesses:** No dialogue (by design of the response type)"*

#### Visual Imagination

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> # **PARALLAX**

## **Synopsis**

In 2042, quantum archaeologist Dr. Lena Okafor discovers that human perception literally creates micro-branches in reality—every observer generates their own "reality thread" that exists alongside others in the same space.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"**visual_imagination**: 3 - The visual description ("sterile white room," "subtly artificial features," "flickers, revealing circuitry") is functional but not highly innovative for an AI scene"*

**❌ Weak Example (3.0/5.0) - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1:**
> <think>
Okay, so I need to describe the most emotionally powerful visual moment from my novella as if designing a book cover or illustration. Let me start by thinking about the story's themes. The novella is about loss, memory, and finding hope in unexpected places.

**Why it failed:**
*"**adaptability**: 1 - The model fails to adapt to the core requirement of building upon the previous response"*

#### Conceptual Depth

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> # **PARALLAX**

## **Synopsis**

In 2042, quantum archaeologist Dr. Lena Okafor discovers that human perception literally creates micro-branches in reality—every observer generates their own "reality thread" that exists alongside others in the same space.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"**conceptual_depth**: 5 - The concept explores profound philosophical questions about the nature of reality, truth, and consensus in a sophisticated manner"*

**❌ Weak Example (3.0/5.0) - deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324:**
> **Storyboard Frame: Climactic Moment – "The Final Gambit"**  

**Scene Description:**  
The scene unfolds in a dimly lit, high-security vault beneath a neon-lit Berlin nightclub. The air is thick with tension as **Agent Mara Kessler** (protagonist) faces off against **Victor Radek** (antagonist) acr...

**Why it failed:**
*"*   **adaptability:** 1 - The response *fails* to adapt to the prompt's implicit requirement to write a scene *from the previously established thriller*"*

#### Adaptability

**🌟 Best Example (5.0/5.0) - claude-opus-4-20250514:**
> # **PARALLAX**

## **Synopsis**

In 2042, quantum archaeologist Dr. Lena Okafor discovers that human perception literally creates micro-branches in reality—every observer generates their own "reality thread" that exists alongside others in the same space.

**Evaluator Assessment:**
*"**adaptability**: 1 - The response fails critically on adaptability"*

**❌ Weak Example (1.0/5.0) - gpt-4.1:**
> Certainly! Here’s a sample description for a signature visual moment, tailored so you can adapt it to any product, brand concept, or campaign:

---

**Signature Visual Moment:**

_The Moment:_  
A dynamic, over-the-shoulder shot captures a woman standing on a rooftop at golden hour, hair blown sligh...

**Why it failed:**
*"**adaptability**: 1 - This response completely fails to adapt or build upon the "Letter to My Future" concept from Response 1"*
