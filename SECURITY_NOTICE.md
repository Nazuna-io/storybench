### ‚úÖ Actions Taken:

2. **Generate a new Google API key** and update `.env` file
3. **Consider git history cleanup** if needed for public repositories

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures in Place:
- `.env` file is ignored by git
- API keys are masked in API responses
- Only environment variable names are referenced in code
- `.env.example` provides template without real keys

### üìã Prevention Checklist:
- [x] `.env` in `.gitignore`
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] API key masking in web interface
- [ ] Revoke exposed key
- [ ] Generate new API key
- [ ] Update documentation about API key security

## For GitHub Security Alert:
The exposed API key is in git history and should be:
1. Revoked immediately in Google Cloud Console
2. Replaced with a new key
3. Git history cleaned if this is a public repository

**File Location in History**: `old_codebase/` directory (now removed)
**Exposed Key Pattern**: `AIzaSyCZ5uXMQaNDF0giT-6Xp-wIE2cr2Xj5nuA`
