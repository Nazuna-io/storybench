Simplified End-to-End Directus Integration Test

This script tests the complete Directus integration pipeline:
1. Demonstrate Directus prompt pattern (mock mode)
2. Generate mock responses 
3. Demonstrate Directus evaluation integration
4. Generate evaluation report

This focuses on testing the Directus integration patterns without 
requiring external API keys or complex evaluator setup.

The atmosphere readings showed breathable air, but something felt fundamentally different here‚Äîas if the very molecules carried whispers of ancient secrets.

Above her, two smaller moons danced in the alien sky, their gravitational pull creating tidal effects in the nearby sea of liquid methane. The research station ahead looked impossibly small against the vast landscape, its solar panels glinting like scattered gems. Elena checked her instruments once more before beginning the walk that would change everything she thought she knew about life in the universe.

Kael had been watching the newcomers for three cycles now, his weathered hands tracing the symbols carved into the ancient stone beneath his feet. His eyes, an unsettling shade of silver that seemed to reflect the planet's twin moons, held depths that spoke of centuries rather than decades.

"You shouldn't have come here," he said, his voice carrying an accent that belonged to no known human colony. The neural interface embedded behind his left ear pulsed with a soft blue light‚Äîtechnology that predated the first wave of terraforming by generations. Dr. Vasquez felt her scientific certainty waver as she met his gaze. This man wasn't just another colonist. He was something far more dangerous: a guardian of truths that could reshape humanity's understanding of its place among the stars.

"Your grandmother," Kael said quietly, "was the first to make contact. Sarah Chen-Vasquez. She didn't return to Earth because she couldn't. The planet chose her, just as it's choosing you now." The crystalline formation pulsed brighter, and Elena felt a strange resonance in her bones, as if every cell in her body was remembering something it had never known.

"The colony ships weren't the first human presence here. We've been coming to Kepler-442b for over two hundred years, drawn by something in our DNA that science can't explain. You're not here to study this planet, Elena. You're here to come home."
