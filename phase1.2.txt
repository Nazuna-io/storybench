Implement functions to fetch a specific PromptSetVersion by its version_number and status: "published".
These functions should retrieve the PromptSetVersion along with its nested PromptSequences and their nested Prompts, ensuring you filter by status: "published" at each level of the hierarchy (sequences and prompts).
The client should handle API authentication using the static token.
Parse the JSON response from Directus into Pydantic models (you might need new Pydantic models that mirror the Directus schema, or adapt existing ones if they are similar enough).
Testing: Write unit tests for this new client to ensure it correctly fetches and parses data from your Directus instance.
