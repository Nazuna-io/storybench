# Checkpoint: Local Model Empty Response Fixes
**Date:** 2025-05-27  
**Commit:** 5244036  
**Status:** MAJOR IMPROVEMENT - Core issue partially resolved

## Problem Solved
Fixed critical empty response issues in local model generation that were causing pipeline failures.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced LocalEvaluator (`src/storybench/evaluators/local_evaluator.py`)
- **Better Response Validation**: Improved null/empty value handling in response extraction
- **Story-Appropriate Retry Logic**: Set 100-character minimum for story generation responses
- **Enhanced Model Reset**: Added model state reset with verification testing
- **Graceful Error Handling**: System continues processing instead of crashing on failures

### 2. Fixed Syntax Errors (`run_end_to_end.py`)
- Corrected duplicate/corrupted code in context management section
- Maintained critical 32k token context window capabilities

### 3. Debug Tools Created
- `reproduce_empty_responses.py` - Reproduces the issue for testing
- `debug_local_generation.py` - Tests individual model generation

## Results
- **Before**: Near-complete failure with frequent empty responses causing pipeline crashes
- **After**: 67% success rate (6/9 prompts successful) with graceful error handling
- **Pipeline Stability**: Now completes successfully instead of failing
- **Performance**: Consistent ~110-115 tokens/sec generation speed

## Remaining Issue
**CRITICAL OBSERVATION**: Still seeing failures at only 867 tokens input, which makes no technical sense given:
- Model has 32k token context window
- Hardware: 12GB VRAM (model only 700MB) 
- Abundant DRAM available
- 867 tokens << 2048 minimum typical context

## Next Investigation Needed
The failures at such low token counts suggest a deeper issue:
1. **Potential Model-Specific Bug**: Gemma 3 1B IT Q2_K_L quantization issues?
2. **llama-cpp-python Configuration**: Incorrect parameters causing premature failures?
3. **Context Building Logic**: Something in prompt construction triggering model confusion?
4. **Memory Management**: Despite available resources, something causing memory pressure?

## Success Metrics
✅ Pipeline stability restored  
✅ Graceful error handling implemented  
✅ Context management preserved  
⚠️ Still 33% failure rate at low token counts (needs investigation)  

## Files Modified
- `src/storybench/evaluators/local_evaluator.py` - Core fixes
- `run_end_to_end.py` - Syntax fixes
- Multiple debug tools created

**Next Priority**: Investigate why failures occur at such low token counts despite ample resources.
