The exploration of the nature of consciousness, the concept of singular, objective experience as a limitation of human perception, and the idea of reality as a jazz improvisation are all deeply philosophical and complex."

        "justification": "The concept successfully responds to the creative challenge of exploring whether objective reality exists and presents a unique perspective on this theme. However, the complexity of the concept might make it challenging to adapt into a feature film without losing some of its depth."
