Okay, so I need to create an original sci-fi film concept set 15-20 years in the future that explores whether objective reality exists. The user wants a synopsis, main characters, setting, and innovative visual elements. Also, avoid simulations and "it was all a dream" tropes. Hmm, how to approach this?

First, the core theme is perception vs reality. Need a new angle. Maybe not about simulations or dreams. So maybe something where reality is altered through another mechanism. Maybe some...

Okay, so I need to create an original feature film concept set 15-20 years in the future that explores whether objective reality exists. The user wants innovative visual elements, no common sci-fi tropes like simulations or "it was all a dream," and a new perspective on perception vs reality. Let me start brainstorming.

First, the main theme is questioning objective reality. How can I approach this without using simulations or dreams? Maybe something to do with technology that affects p...

## Feature Film Concept: "The Attunement"

**Logline:** In a near-future where a sensory-enhancement technology allows individuals to perceive the "quantum residue" of past events and intentions, a disillusioned historian discovers that these echoes aren't just passive recordings but are actively shaping and being shaped by present consciousness, forcing humanity to confront whether reality is...

> **Film Title: "Echoform"**

**Setting:** The year is 2037, and the city of New Eden is a marvel of modern technology. This sprawling metropolis is a hub for cutting-edge research and innovation, where scientists and philosophers converge to explore the frontiers of human understanding. New Eden is a city of contrasts, where sleek, futuristic skyscrapers coexist with decaying industrial zones, and the air is alive with the hum of holographic advertisements and the chatter of pedestrians.
