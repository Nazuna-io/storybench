- Security: Removed hardcoded API keys from server scripts
- All debugging scripts and investigation files committed
- Note: Some commits with API keys in history - will need git filter-branch if required

âœ… Database Cleanup - COMPLETED
- Removed 3 evaluations
- Removed 180 responses  
- Removed 179 LLM evaluations
- Total deleted: 362 documents
- Database is now completely empty and ready for fresh evaluations

âœ… Configurations Preserved - INTACT
- API Keys: 3 (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) âœ…
- Models: 5 (ready to evaluate) âœ…
- Prompts: 2 (FilmNarrative, LiteraryNarrative) âœ…
- Criteria: 3 (evaluation configurations with 1 active) âœ…

âœ… System Health - EXCELLENT

ðŸš€ SYSTEM READY FOR PRODUCTION EVALUATIONS
The investigation revealed that the evaluation system was working correctly all along:
- Response generation works perfectly
- LLM evaluation runs automatically after response generation
- Rich sequence-aware scoring with detailed justifications
- Multiple evaluation runs for validation
- Comprehensive database storage

Issues resolved:
âœ… Console output clarity (misleading "complete" message after response phase)
âœ… Sequence filtering logic verified as working correctly
âœ… Criteria activation confirmed functional
âœ… Background evaluation service workflow validated

Next steps:
1. Start fresh evaluations with confidence
2. Web interface available at http://localhost:8000
3. All models ready for comprehensive creativity assessment
4. Results will display properly with detailed scoring breakdown

ðŸŽ¯ The system is production-ready for large-scale model evaluation! ðŸš€
